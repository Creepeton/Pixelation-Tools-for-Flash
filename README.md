(All done in Flash btw, sprites by the Sripters' Ressource)

Compatibe for Macromedia Flash and further ... I think

## Tutorial

Select the frames you want to pixelate/round coordinates (on ONE layer) and run the script!

## Issues (I won't fix)

- It only works for 1 layer at a time
- It only pixelates keyframes and tween frames
